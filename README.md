# RickRoll-BashScript

There are 3 types of scripts.

1. remove-rickroll.bat
   > Removes the rickroll (sometimes needs admin perms)

2. rickroll-EASY.bat
   > The script will show how to remove the rickroll for 5 seconds on every start up. The file is also visible.

3. rickroll-BITCH.bat
   > The script won't show anything on every start up. The file is hidden


Enjoy! ;)
